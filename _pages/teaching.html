    Statistics is a branch of mathematics working with data collection, data organization, data analysis, interpretation and presentation.<br/>
    Statistics is very important to understand the theories behind Machine Learning and Deep Learning. <br/>
    Statistics can be majorly divided into: <br/>
    
    <li> <a href="https://rakash.github.io/teaching/desstats-1">Descriptive Statistics</a></li>
    <li> Inferential Statistics </li> <br/>
        
  <a href = "https://rakash.github.io/teaching/resdes">Research Design</a> is an important topic before you get into descriptive and inferential statistics. <br/><br/>

    Analytics is a collection of techniques and tools used for creating value from data.<br/>
    Techniques include concepts such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.<br/>
    AI, ML, and DL are defined as follows:<br/>
    <ol>
    <li> Artificial Intelligence: Algorithms and systems that exhibit human-like intelligence.</li>
    <li> Machine Learning: Subset of AI that can learn to perform a task with extracted data and/or models.</li>
    <li> Deep Learning: Subset of machine learning that imitate the functioning of human brain to solve problems.</li>
   </ol>
  
  Some of the Applications of AI(ML and DL) are: <br/>
  <ol>
    <li> <a href="https://rakash.github.io/teaching/cv_01"> Computer Vision</a></li>
    <li> Natural Language Processing </li>
    <li> Structured Data Analysis </li>
   </ol>
