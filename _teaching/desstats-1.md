Descriptive statistics is the use of statistical and graphic techniques to present information about
the data set being studied. Computing descriptive statistics and examining graphic
displays of data is an advisable preliminary step in data analysis. Descriptive statistics and graphic displays are
also the final product in some contexts: for instance, a business may want to
monitor total volume of sales for its different locations without any desire to use
that information to make inferences about other businesses.
